The above video details 10 creative synth layering ideas, by "SynthHacker"

The 10 ideas are:

1. Call and Response
Reverse a synth chord and play it alongside it's original chord to lead into the next chord stab.

2. Mechanical Sampler Sounds
In Instruments/Sampled based instruments, you can isolate the mechanical noise and accentuate it.

3. Keytracked Noise
Start with a noise sample.

Then take a descending chord progression.

GateTrigger the noise with the same midi, but add a keytracked bandpass filter.  Serum's keytracking is polyphonic.

4. Pitch Envelopes
Apply pitch envelopes to your noise and layer with synth.

5. Granular Resampling
Make a sample of your synth sound and then bring into a granular synth. (Quanta by Audio Damage)
Can then use this for similar to call and response.  

6. Do something similar with reverb, with sidechain compression

7. Physical Modelling.  Imagine synth.


8. Extreme pitched layers. 
Adds a nice sparkle to the mix by adding a layer with the highest possible pitch for the oscillator

9.  Vocoder Layering
Duophonic synth melody.  Switch meoldy into two tracks.  

10. Polyphonic Splitting
