(Website) The ultimate resource to prepare for coding interviews.
Everything you need, in one streamlined platform.

Pricing:
Basic package is $99 for 1 year

AlgoExpert is a platform for preparing for coding interviews and practicing algorithms and data structures. It is a good choice for those looking for a curated, interview-focused set of problems with video explanations. However, its limited problem set, lack of community support, and subscription cost may make other platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank more attractive for some users.

**Pros:**

Curated content: AlgoExpert offers a carefully curated list of problems, specifically designed to cover the most important concepts and topics in coding interviews.
Video explanations: Each problem on AlgoExpert comes with a detailed video explanation, making it easier to understand the solution and the thought process behind it.
Interview-focused: AlgoExpert is tailored for interview preparation and covers questions frequently asked in interviews at top tech companies.
Integrated coding environment: AlgoExpert provides an integrated coding environment, allowing you to write, test, and debug code directly on the platform.
Variety of languages: The platform supports multiple programming languages, giving you the flexibility to practice in your preferred language.

**Cons:**

Limited problem set: AlgoExpert's problem set is smaller compared to other platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank, which might not provide enough practice for some users.
Cost: AlgoExpert requires a subscription to access its content, unlike some other platforms that offer free access to a significant portion of their resources.
Community support: AlgoExpert does not have a large community like LeetCode, which can make it harder to find help or discuss problems with other users.
Lack of variety: AlgoExpert mainly focuses on data structures and algorithms, so it might not be suitable for those looking to practice other types of coding challenges.
No competitive programming: AlgoExpert doesn't host coding competitions, which can be a motivating way to practice and improve your skills.
