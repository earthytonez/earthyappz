The schedule determines what your character will do throughout the day. \n  
The current time can be seen in the footer.  Drag and drop activities from 
the list on the left into the schedule to change it.  Beware, some activities 
take time. For instance, you have to walk to a water source before you can drink. 
Additionally, some tasks are more efficient the longer you spend on them  So 
make sure you're giving yourself enough time to complete the tasks.
