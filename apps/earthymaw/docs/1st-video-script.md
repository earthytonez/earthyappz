## Introducing the Earthy Tonez MAW

About 10 years ago I wrote a song that started like this:

[Misanthropic Glee on Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/earthy-tonez)

It's very simple.  Alot of my songs start this way.  Some simple loop like this.  I often sit down to play music and I want to be able to capture ideas quickly.  Bit sequencing generally falls into two categories.  There's sequences that 

What's interesting is that there is a fair bit of shared language around sequencing.  Stabs, arepggiations.  4/4 Kick.  We all know what the hi-hats on a house track sound like.  So my question was, could you create a sequencer that would encapsulate this stuff.  Make reaching for ideas easier and make those ideas modulateable.  

Right now sequencing is mostly split into two categories.  Sequencing that is very controllable, like a step sequencer, and sequencing that is more random or algorithmic, but can be less predictable.  So my question is what if you could have something in between.  A sequencer that is very flexible in terms of how it can be used and modulated, but also predictable.

So the Earthy Maw is an experiment, in creating these sequencers, and here's an example that matches that song I wrote.

So where do we go with this?  More sequencers, more modulation.  Maybe one day those sequencers are shareable, and you can create and download or mix and match what you get.  Maybe those sequencers get integrated into some kind of hardware.  

But what about this tool, this "Modular Audio Workstation"  I imagine this tool
