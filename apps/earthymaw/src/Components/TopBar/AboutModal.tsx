          Earthy Maw is two things
          <br />
          <br />
          1: It's a generative music maker. Earthy Maw can be used to make (and
          eventually share) generative songs
          <br />
          <br />
          2: It's an experiment in predictable, customizable modulatable
          sequencers. Sequencing generally fits into two categories. The first
          is step sequencers, which let you control every note that is played.
          Length, pitch, volume, etc. The second is random or algorithmic
          sequencers. These tend to be less tangibly predictable and more likely
          to produce "happy accidents", though they can be easy to adjust for
          live performance. I hope to create something in between. Sequencers
          that although they are individually less flexible, are easier to
          understand what they do, and what will happen when you change them.
