documentation = 'The directional intervals sequencer is an 8 step sequencer that where each step is an interval of the step before it.  So if in the key/scale of C major, if the first step is a zero, the first note will be a C.  If the second interval is a 1, the second note will be a D.  The interval direction can be used to choose if the note goes up.  From a C, 1 step up will be a D, one step down will be a B.  The real magic comes in the "either" setting.  \"Either" means that it will randomly choose up or down, creating a melody that should be similar to other random memories.  The more "eithers" in your melody, the more chaotic the possibilities.'
